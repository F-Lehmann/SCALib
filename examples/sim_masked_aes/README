This is an example of usage of SCALE in ordre to attack a masked
implementation. It simulates a simple masked implementation leaking with an HW
model, arbitrary number of shares and noise standard deviation. See the file
"settings.py" to modify the number of files, traces, shares and noise. 


USAGE:
    ./run_all.sh
    ./clean.sh
